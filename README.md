# Implement CNN from scratch
CNN belong to a particular type of artificial neural networks used mostly for computer vision. Unlike traditional neural networks that are based on matrix multiplication, CNN use convolution as its main distinctive technique. In mathematics, convolution is an operation involving two functions which produces another function showing how one functionâ€™s structure is changed by the other. This convolution process is important for feature extraction and processing of images within CNN.
